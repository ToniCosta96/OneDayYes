DescripcionIndex1: ONE DAY YES</span>was born with the aim of guaranteeing the<span style="color:#608035;font-weight:bold;"> education and feeding </span> of the children that make up the Twashukuru school, to consolidate, become self-sufficient and generate local employment in the <span style="color:#608035;font-weight:bold;"> Lamu community. </span> A worthwhile project. A project that you discover when you least expect it. A project that <span style="color:#608035;font-weight:bold;"> changes lives. </span> A project that makes us <span style="color:#608035;font-weight:bold;"> better people. </span> A project for those who bet on the direct impact of their contribution. A simple, familiar and local project. A project with a <span style="color:#608035;font-weight:bold;"> very special philosophy.</span><p>
DescripcionIndex2: <p>This school is more than a school. Is a <span style="color:#608035;font-weight:bold;">life proyect</span> for children and the community of Lamu. It is an authentic project that is born under the protection of recycling. The school is built with <span style="color:#608035;font-weight:bold;">plastic and glass bottles</span>  that are collected from the garbage of Lamu. It is a school with a sustainable philosophy based on recycling and where, in addition, music has a special role.</p>
DescripcionIndex3: <p>Outside of Lamu our work focuses on <span style="color:#608035;font-weight:bold;">sensitize the European population.</span> Make the Swahili culture known and make known the other Africa. Africa joyful, exciting and positive despite the poverty in which they live. Africa that penetrates, Africa strong, great and beautiful. <span style="color:#608035;font-weight:bold;">The Africa of 37 children in Lamu who smile at life. </ Span> For this we organize activities of all kinds, from concerts, photo exhibitions, talks, conferences, auctions ... Where we present this project and try <span style="color:#608035;font-weight:bold;">attract partners and raise financing.</span></p>
DescripcionIndex4: <p>But the most important part of our awareness-raising work is to work with children in Europe. For this we organize workshops with children in schools to raise awareness from a very young age and to know the reality that children in Africa live. <span style="color:#608035;font-weight:bold;">they play, they laugh and they are happy, </ span> they have another culture, other customs, other religions ... And that, however different they may seem, at the end of the road, they are children like that. <span style="color:#608035;font-weight:bold;">We are all equal.</span>  We want you to feel close to them and not be true ignorant of what happens in the rest of the world. Yes! Always with a smile in his mouth. From a positive perspective, to grow together and <span style="color:#608035;font-weight:bold;">build a better world together</span></p>

DescripcionSafari: Excursion to see or photograph wild animals, made in Africa or in other territories. This is a definition of the word safari. Well, that's what it's about. In this case, of course, in the field of other territories. It is necessary to say that these animals are free and that visitors can not leave their own vehicles.
DescripcionGolf: Golf is a precision sport, whose goal is to introduce a ball in the holes that are distributed in the field with the least number of strokes, which uses a type of blow between a set of shoes different from each other, since the The head of the club has different degrees, just as the rods have different lengths. The lower the number of degrees, the greater the length of the rod and therefore the greater distance. A maximum of 14 sticks can be carried. The one who practices golf is called a golfer.
DescripcionBuceo: Diving is an underwater activity that can be done for recreational, investigative or sporting purposes. It consists of entering the water and submerging in the whole body, so, in general, it can be used with the help of some type of equipment that allows the child to come to the surface to breathe
DescripcionBarca: It is an activity that consists of exploring the island of Lamu from a boat accompanied by a tour guide and more explorers. You can also request this type of activity to go from Mount Kenya (when climbing) to the island itself. Do not forget to bring a good camera to capture the best possible moments.
DescripcionRafting: Rafting is a sport and recreational activity that consists in traversing the riverbed in the direction of the current (downstream), usually on some type of boat or raft. Usually the rivers that are navigated have some degree of turbulence, these are also called white water rivers because this color is characteristic of the foam that generates turbulence in the bodies of water. The most common boats that are used are the raft, the canoe or the kayak, which can be rigid.
DescripcionMuseo: The museums of Lamu are located on the north coast, are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most beautiful and peaceful places on the African continent. The buildings that can be visited are the Lamu Museum, the Fort of Lamu, the German post office, the Swahili house and the ruins of Takwa. The National Museums of Kenya contribute to preserve and promote this rich cultural heritage in collaboration with some partners in the annual cultural festival of Lamu.
DescripcionCascada: The waterfall is a 74 m high waterfall from Kenya located on the Ewaso Ng'iro River, which drains from the Aberdare Mountains. It is located near the municipality of Nyahururu, in the county of Laikipia, at 2360 meters above sea level. In 1883, the Scottish naturalist Joseph Thomson was the first European to reach the waterfall, which is why he called them his father. He was also the first European to travel from Mombasa to Lake Victoria in the 1880s. The fog feeds on the dense nearby forest. Visitors can see the falls from above, but there is also a path to the bottom of a ravine. Upstream of the falls, are some of the largest hippo pools in Kenya.
DescripcionEscalada: Climbing, in mountaineering, is an activity that involves making ascents on steeply sloping walls, using your own physical and mental strength. Climbing is considered any ascent either easy, difficult or impossible to perform (depending on the physical state of the person) with the lower extremities (feet and legs, in some cases you could also get to use the knee, if there is any wall to the side) and the upper extremities (arms and hands). In climbing there are heights that involve a considerable danger and with the objective of having security, protective equipment is used.
